Make
Run the server program
- Usage: server [port]
Run the client program
- Usage: client name ip port
- Type quit to log off as user

Notes:
- I modified the client program from hw7 to send their name to the server at the very beginning.
- In class, you suggested us to use lpthread when compiling, but it did not work in my system (Ubuntu).  Instead, I used pthread.
